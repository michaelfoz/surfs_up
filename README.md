### surfs_up (UCD Module 9) Analysis Overview:
The tools we used in this module are (1) SQLite, (2) SQLAlchemy, and (3) FLASK.
#### SQLite is a version of SQL that is stored locally--as opposed to being stored on a database server--and runs on a computer or a phone.  We find that local databases support faster testing and prototyping.  In this Module, we use SQLAlchemny, which is a query tool designed for SQLite;  this tool is useful when integrating statistical analyses with dataframe analyses.  In addition, we use FLASK, which is a web framework that uses Python to build web pages.  Web pages are a useful and dynamic way to display data and come in handy in instances where people aren't able to run your code themselves.
#### For the assignemnt, we compare weather data from two different months in year.  This weather data will be taken into consideration when starting a retail/shake shop in Hawaii.
### Results--comparing the months of June and December:

#### ● The average temperature for the month of June (rounded to the nearest decimal) is 75.0 degrees Farenheit; the average temperature for the month of December is 71.0 degrees Farenheit.
#### ● The min/lowest temperature for the month of June is 64.0 degrees Farenheit; the min/lowest temperature for the month of December is 56.0 degrees Farenheit.
#### ● The max/highest temperature for the month of June is 85.0 degrees fareheit; the max/highest temperature for the month of Dececember is 83.0 degrees Farenheit.
### Overall: temperatures in June are warmer compared to December.

### It would benefit the business to have more inventory of surfing equipment as well as shakes during June.
